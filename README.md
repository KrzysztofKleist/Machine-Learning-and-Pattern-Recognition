# MLaPR

Project for Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition course regarding detection of quality of wine.

## About

Problem was simplified to binary classification. The goal of the project was to classify the *Test.txt* set of wines based on *Training.txt* given 10 different parameters of each sample.

## Acquired Skills

The project aimed at learning and utilizing knowledge od basics of Machine Learning without using in-built and external Machine Learning libraries (limitation to numpy, scipy and matplotlib). All the methods used in the project where written using libraries mentioned earlier.
In the project I present methods like:

- PCA
- LDA
- various variations of Gaussian Models
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Gaussian Mixture Models
- model evaluation methods

Further details regarding theoretical aspects and outcome of the project are attached in *report.pdf*.
